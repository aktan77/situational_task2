Sure, here's a basic documentation for the provided Jenkins pipeline:

# Jenkins Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This Jenkins pipeline is designed to automate the testing and deployment process of a Kubernetes application. It consists of two main stages: **Test** and **Deploy to Kubernetes**.

## Requirements

- Jenkins server configured with necessary plugins (e.g., Pipeline, Pipeline AWS Plugin).
- AWS CLI installed and configured with appropriate credentials.
- Kubernetes cluster set up on AWS EKS (Elastic Kubernetes Service).

## Pipeline Structure

The pipeline is defined using the Jenkins Pipeline DSL (Domain Specific Language). Here's a breakdown of its structure:

### 1. Agent Declaration

```groovy
agent any
```

Specifies that the pipeline can execute on any available Jenkins agent.

### 2. Stages

#### a. Test Stage

```groovy
stage('Test') {
    steps {
        sh 'echo hello'
    }
}
```

Executes a simple test step, echoing "hello".

#### b. Deploy to Kubernetes Stage

```groovy
stage('Deploy to Kubernetes') {
    steps {
        configFileProvider([configFile(fileId: 'situational_task1', variable: 'CONFIG_FILE')]){
            sh "aws eks update-kubeconfig --region us-east-1 --name dev-eks"
        }
        withCredentials([[$class: 'AmazonWebServicesCredentialsBinding', accessKeyVariable: 'AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID', credentialsId: 'creds', secretKeyVariable: 'AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY']])
        {
            sh "kubectl apply -f k8s/"
        }
    }
}
```

- Updates the Kubernetes configuration using AWS CLI for the specified AWS EKS cluster.
- Applies Kubernetes manifests located in the 'k8s/' directory to deploy the application.

### 3. Post-Build Actions (Commented Out)

```groovy
// post {
//     success {
//         echo 'Deployment successful'
//     }
//     failure {
//         echo 'Deployment failed'
//     }
// }
```

This section defines actions to be performed after the pipeline execution completes. Currently, it is commented out, but it can be used to provide feedback based on deployment success or failure.

## Usage

1. Create a Jenkins job and configure it to use this pipeline script.
2. Ensure that Jenkins has necessary permissions and credentials to access AWS and Kubernetes.
3. Customize the pipeline script as needed for your specific application and environment.
4. Run the Jenkins job to execute the pipeline.

## Note

- Ensure that all necessary dependencies and configurations are in place before running the pipeline.
- Review and adjust AWS and Kubernetes commands according to your environment setup.
- Handle post-build actions based on your project requirements.

Feel free to customize this documentation further based on your project's specific requirements and environment setup.
