# Dockerized React App Deployment Pipeline & Number System Converter

This repository contains a Dockerized React application for converting numbers between different number systems and a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline script for automating the deployment process.

## Dockerized React App Deployment Pipeline

### Pipeline Overview

The CI pipeline is defined in a Jenkinsfile and automates the deployment process of the React application using Docker containers. The pipeline consists of the following stages:

1. **Build**: Builds the Docker image for the React application using a Dockerfile.
2. **Login**: Authenticates with Docker Hub using provided credentials to enable pushing the built image.
3. **Push an image to Docker Hub**: Pushes the built Docker image to Docker Hub repository.
4. **Post Actions**: Logs out of Docker after the pipeline execution.

### Docker Configuration

#### Dockerfile

The Dockerfile in the `application/` directory is responsible for building the Docker image. It uses a multi-stage build:

1. **Build Stage**: Utilizes a Node.js image to install dependencies and build the React application.
2. **Final Stage**: Uses an Nginx image to serve the built React application.

## Number System Converter

### Overview

The Number System Converter is a React application that allows users to convert numbers between decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal number systems.

### Features

- Convert numbers between decimal, binary, hexadecimal, and octal formats.
- Real-time conversion as you type.
- User-friendly interface with dropdowns and input fields.

### Usage

1. Select the input number system (Decimal, Binary, Hexadecimal, Octal) from the dropdown.
2. Select the output number system.
3. Enter the value you want to convert in the input field.
4. Click the "Convert" button.
5. The converted value will be displayed below the input field.
