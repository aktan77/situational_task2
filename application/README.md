# Jenkins Pipeline Documentation

## Overview

This Jenkins pipeline automates the process of building a Docker image for a specified application, logging in to Docker Hub using provided credentials, pushing the built image to Docker Hub, and finally logging out of Docker.

## Requirements

- Jenkins server with Pipeline support.
- Docker installed on Jenkins server.
- Docker Hub account for pushing Docker images.
- Jenkins credentials set up for Docker Hub login.

## Pipeline Structure

The pipeline consists of several stages:

### 1. Agent Declaration

```groovy
agent any
```

Specifies that the pipeline can execute on any available Jenkins agent.

### 2. Environment Variables

```groovy
environment {
    DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS = credentials('docker-creds')
}
```

Defines an environment variable `DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS` to store Docker Hub credentials retrieved from Jenkins credentials with ID 'docker-creds'.

### 3. Stages

#### a. Build Stage

```groovy
stage('Build') {
    steps {
        sh 'docker build -t aktan55/st2_app:latest application/'
    }
}
```

Builds a Docker image tagged as `aktan55/st2_app:latest` using the Dockerfile located in the 'application/' directory.

#### b. Login Stage

```groovy
stage('Login') {
    steps {
        sh 'echo $DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_PSW | docker login -u $DOCKERHUB_CREDENTIALS_USR --password-stdin'
    }
}
```

Logs in to Docker Hub using the provided Docker Hub credentials.

#### c. Push Image to Docker Hub Stage

```groovy
stage('Push an image to docker hub1') {
    steps {
        sh 'docker push aktan55/st2_app:latest'
    }
}
```

Pushes the built Docker image (`aktan55/st2_app:latest`) to Docker Hub.

### 4. Post-Build Actions

```groovy
post {
    always {
        sh 'docker logout'
    }
}
```

Logs out of Docker after the pipeline execution, ensuring proper cleanup.

## Usage

1. Create a Jenkins job and configure it to use this pipeline script.
2. Set up Jenkins credentials for Docker Hub login with ID 'docker-creds'.
3. Customize the pipeline script as needed for your application and environment.
4. Run the Jenkins job to execute the pipeline.
